# ImGui-Beef
**imgui-beef** is a Beef wrapper library for [Dear ImGui v1.75](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

**Attention!** This binding is deprecated! I suggest to use the wrapper maintained by RougeMacro: https://github.com/RogueMacro/imgui-beef that's an automatically generated wrapper for cimgui, so it's always up to date and it's guaranteed that doesn't have type mismatch errors (which this hand written dirty work is filled with)
